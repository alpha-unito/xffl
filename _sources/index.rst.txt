Cross-Facility Federated Learning (xFFL) documentation
======================================================

`Cross-Facility Federated Learning (xFFL) <https://hpc4ai.unito.it/hpc-federation>`_ is a federated learning (FL) framework based on the `StreamFlow workflow management system (WMS) <https://streamflow.di.unito.it>`_ developed in the `Parallel Computing Alpha research group <https://alpha.di.unito.it>`_ at the University of Turin, Italy.

xFFL is designed to be a research-oriented software, enabling FL workloads deployment on geographically distributed computing infrastructures including, but not limited to, high-performance computers (HPCs).

We aim to democratize extensive ML workload development, allowing researchers and SMEs to be competitive with big tech companies by exploiting sparse computing power.
